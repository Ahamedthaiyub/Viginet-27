## Problem Statement

In an increasingly interconnected digital landscape, organizations face an escalating threat of cybersecurity breaches and attacks. The challenge lies in efficiently detecting and responding to these threats to safeguard sensitive data, critical systems, and maintain business continuity. Traditional security measures often fall short in identifying sophisticated and evolving threats, necessitating a comprehensive solution that combines continuous monitoring and advanced analytics.


## Solution 
Our project addresses this problem by developing a Viginet Breach Detection System (VBDS) with Machine Learning capabilities. This system aims to proactively detect security breaches, unauthorized access, and malicious activities within an organization's network and systems. By leveraging ML algorithms and real-time monitoring, VBDS enhances the organization's ability to identify, assess, and respond to security incidents swiftly and effectively.


## Introducing Viginet Breach Detection Systems 
In today's dynamic cybersecurity landscape, Viginet Breach Detection Systems, armed with Machine Learning capabilities, are indispensable. These systems leverage ML algorithms to continuously monitor network traffic and system logs, swiftly identifying anomalies and potential breaches. By learning from vast datasets and historical incidents, they adeptly discern legitimate activities from malicious intrusions. This proactive approach empowers organizations to fortify their defenses, respond promptly to threats, and safeguard critical assets and sensitive data in the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.

Identifies abnormal patterns, network anomalies, and unusual data transfer activities, triggering alerts for potential breaches.

## Getting Started-

This repository contains Python code for training deep learning and machine learning models for network intrusion detection. The models are trained on two different datasets: KDD Cup 1999 and UNSW-NB15.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage

### Deep Learning Models (Keras)

1. Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import os
   from time import time
   from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, CuDNNLSTM, CuDNNGRU, RNN, LSTM, GRU
   from keras import Sequential
   from keras.callbacks import TensorBoard, ModelCheckpoint
   from kdd_processing import kdd_encoding
   from unsw_processing import unsw_encoding
   from results_visualisation import print_results
   ```

2. Define the parameters for your training:

   ```python
   csv_values = ['epochs', 'acc', 'loss', 'val_acc', 'val_loss', "train_data",
                 "features_nb", 'loss_fct', 'optimizer', 'activation_fct',
                 'layer_nb', 'unit_nb', 'batch_size', 'dropout', 'cell_type',
                 'encoder']
   
   csv_best_res = ['param', 'value', 'min_mean_val_loss']
   
   params = {
       'epochs': 3,
       'train_data': 494021,
       'features_nb': 4,
       'loss_fct': 'mse',
       'optimizer': 'rmsprop',
       'activation_fct': 'sigmoid',
       'layer_nb': 1,
       'unit_nb': 128,
       'batch_size': 1024,
       'dropout': 0.2,
       'cell_type': 'CuDNNLSTM',
       'encoder': 'labelencoder',
       'dataset': 'kdd',
       'training_nb': 1,
       'resultstocsv': False,
       'resultstologs': False,
       'showresults': True,
       'shuffle': True
   }
   
   params_var = {
       'encoder': ['standardscaler', 'labelencoder', 'minmaxscaler01', 'minmaxscaler11', 'ordinalencoder'],
       'optimizer': ['adam', 'sgd', 'rmsprop', 'nadam', 'adamax', 'adadelta'],
       'activation_fct': ['sigmoid', 'softmax', 'relu', 'tanh'],
       'layer_nb': [1, 2, 3, 4],
       'unit_nb': [4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256],
       'dropout': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
       'batch_size': [512, 1024, 2048]
   }
   ```

3. Load and preprocess your data using the `load_data` function. You can choose between the 'kdd' and 'unsw' datasets:

   ```python
   x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = load_data()
   ```

4. Train your deep learning model using the `train_model` function:

   ```python
   history = train_model(x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test)
   ```

5. If you want to save the results to a CSV file, you can use the `res_to_csv` function:

   ```python
   res_to_csv()
   ```

6. Run your script and observe the training results.
